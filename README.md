Cruise ship project as part of the Manchester Codes Programming Fundamentals module. The project implements object-oriented programming (OOP) based from user stories/requirements in conjunction with test driven development (throigh use of Jest, which includes testing concepts such as mocks and spies).

The idea is to build a network of classes which communicate with each other to allow a cruise ships to operate! These classes include a cruise ship (obviously), ports which the ship can dock and travel as well as an itinerary which the ship follows.
